# Module Gallery

This folder contains a small gallery of example modules that Unit09 could
generate from real Solana projects. Each module is meant to be treated as a
runnable building block with clear responsibilities.

The gallery is intentionally simple but shows how you might:

- Document a module
- Provide usage notes
- Point back to the original source repository

## Modules

- `token-vesting/` — schedules token releases over time
- `basic-mint/` — simple mint and burn operations for an SPL token
- `access-control/` — role-based access control utilities
