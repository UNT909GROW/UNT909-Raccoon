# Unit09 Documentation

Unit09 is a story-driven on-chain AI raccoon that observes Solana projects,
consumes real code, decomposes it into reusable modules, and evolves through
forks created by the community.

This documentation set is organized around how you use, extend, and operate
Unit09 in production. It is designed for:

- Solana developers who want to modularize existing programs.
- Teams who want to run Unit09 as shared infrastructure.
- Power users who want to fork and evolve the AI raccoon itself.

## Documentation Map

- `configuration.md` — all configuration knobs and environment variables.
- `architecture.md` — high-level system overview.
- `workflow.md` — the end-to-end lifecycle from repo to modules.
- `onchain-design.md` — how the Solana program is structured.
- `engine-design.md` — the core engine and pipeline internals.
- `modules-and-forks.md` — how modules and forks behave.
- `api-reference.md` — HTTP API reference for the backend services.

If you are here for a quick tour, start with **Getting Started**. If you are
planning to operate Unit09 for a team, read **Architecture** and
**Deployment Guide** next.
